#"Employee Directory App built on AWS" project.#
In this project, I'll guide you through the process of launching an employee directory application on an Amazon EC2 instance using the default VPC.

## Project Steps

### 1. Launching EC2 Instance
- Navigate to the AWS console and access the EC2 dashboard.
- Launch a new EC2 instance, providing configurations for the instance.

### 2. Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
- Select the Amazon Linux 2023 AMI, a template containing the necessary software configuration for the instance.

### 3. Instance Type
- Choose the T2 micro instance type, which is free-tier eligible and meets our requirements.

### 4. Key Pair and Network Settings
- Opt to proceed without a key pair.
- Configure network settings using the default VPC and subnet, enabling auto-assigned public IP for direct access.

### 5. Security Group
- Set up a security group to allow HTTPS and HTTP traffic while disabling SSH.

### 6. Storage and IAM Instance Profile
- Configure storage settings, leaving the root volume unchanged.
- Select the IAM instance profile (employee web app role) with permissions for S3 and DynamoDB.

### 7. User Data
- Provide a Bash script for downloading and installing the application.
- The script includes setting up Python, Flask, and dependencies, downloading the application from S3, and configuring environment variables.


### 8. Launch Instance
- Initiate the launch of the instance, allowing AWS to build necessary components, including security groups.

### 9. Instance Status
- Monitor the instance status checks until both have passed.

### 10. Accessing the Application
- Once the instance is running, access the public IP address in a new tab to view the employee directory application.
